# MSCSuduku
MSVisualStudio C++ Sudoku
I wanted a version of Sudoku without adverts and started programming one in c++ VS. 
I realized I needed help so searched and found a java example and converted it to c++. 
This version shows the use of recursive calling to build the board, in java they relied on the memory manager to clean up 
and in c++ I do it in the code.
I also demonstrate the use of a state machine in the game play and ending.
You will need to install Microsoft visual studio to compile with.
Download the sorce.
Load the solution MSCSuduku into VS and compile.
There are no adds and no sounds. And you are free to modify it any way you please.
